# Synthetic Lethality Schema

This is a [LinkML](https://github.com/biolink/biolinkml/) schema for synthetic lethality data.

It describes the TSV format in the generated `SL_data.tsv` file.

This gives us a few things

 - a description of all the fields used
 - mappings of terms to ontologies for some controlled fields (see the enums section)
 - makes it easier to map to TSV to a KG following the biolink schema
